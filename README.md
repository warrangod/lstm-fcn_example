# LSTM-FCN Model Training, Evaluation and Confusion Matrix Example

This project demonstrates the use of a Long Short-Term Memory Fully Convolutional Network (LSTM-FCN) model for time series classification. 
It includes code for training and evaluating the model, as well as code for exploring the confusion matrix.
